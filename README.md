## Troubleshooting

If some errors appear during the `terraform apply` process, please read the error messages and try to solve them. For example:

If the `terraform apply` command does hangs up and does not finish, please, check your infrastructure in GCP console, and manually **remove the elements** shown in previous screenshots, if any of them were created in a previous execution and they are still there.
